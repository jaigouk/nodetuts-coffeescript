# Even though you requested a coupon code, 
# you might not get the code easily from joyent.
#
# How did I get the code?
#
# I used the sales chat in the http://www.joyentcloud.com/
# I asked a sales person really nicely.
# He said that they're so busy that it's hard to 
# setup a new server! No.de is booming.
# So, after a few hours, I got the coupon code finally. :D
# no.de server is a lot faster than heroku.
